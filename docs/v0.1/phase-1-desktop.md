# v0.1 Phase 1 desktop integration spike

The Phase 0 baseline is the canonical merge
[`6e5b57401e17baf438b155488e8eea12b6c4f64e`](https://github.com/tito-pereira/Corinthos/commit/6e5b57401e17baf438b155488e8eea12b6c4f64e),
tree `6e87ebbbe55c0e62f231e4152974500815e098ea`.
Its [post-merge CI](https://github.com/tito-pereira/Corinthos/actions/runs/43406847574)
passed all five jobs. See the [Phase 0 compatibility records](baseline.md).

## Shared read boundary

`corinthos status --root PATH` and the desktop sidecar call the same
[application operations](../../src/corinthos/application/__init__.py).
The CLI emits JSON with version, project status and known provider rows.
Project status inspects the supplied directory, bootstrap and existing store.
Storage is absent, current, legacy, invalid or unverified. Passive reads do
not create a workspace, migrate SQLite, update recent projects or rewrite
provider settings. Paths are limited to 4,096 characters. Windows UNC,
device and drive-relative paths are rejected. SQLite inspection uses an
immutable connection and leaves journaled, changing or time-limited state
unverified. The SQLite VM inspection budget is two seconds.
The provider view reports explicit choices and compatible
historical observations. An absent observation remains unobserved. A stale
or nonmatching observation carries no current availability or command authority.
The CLI returns a null provider section if it cannot read provider settings.

The packaged React view shows the negotiated application and protocol versions,
connection state, known provider status and the result of an explicit project
path check. Rust owns process lifecycle and transports only these operations.
The WebView receives no shell capability and ships its frontend locally.
No-argument `corinthos` continues to open the CLI Home.

## RPC v1 over stdio

Run the backend entry point as
`python -I -B -X utf8 -m corinthos.application.sidecar` with an interpreter
that already has Corinthos installed. Its stdout is reserved for protocol
messages. Transport is UTF-8, with one JSON-RPC 2.0 object per line and a
65,536-byte frame limit excluding the newline. JSON escapes embedded newlines.
Responses echo the request ID. IDs are bounded strings or safe integers.
Protocol version 1 is independent of package, SQLite and contract versions.

| Method | Params | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `system.handshake` | `{"protocol_version":1}` | Protocol version, package version and supported methods. |
| `system.version` | Empty | Package version. |
| `project.status` | `{"root":"PATH"}` | Directory, initialization and storage status. |
| `providers.status` | Empty or `{"root":"PATH"}` | Configured choices and cached capabilities, optionally using project selection. |
| `system.shutdown` | Empty | `{"stopping":true}` and orderly exit. Use a request ID. |

The sidecar emits `system.ready` on startup and `system.stopping` on orderly
shutdown. Negotiate version 1 before requesting application methods.
Malformed JSON returns `-32700`. Invalid requests or oversized frames
return `-32600`, unknown methods `-32601`, invalid parameters `-32602`
and sanitized internal failures `-32603`. Negotiation errors use
`-32001` and unavailable state or an oversized result uses `-32002`.
The [versioned schemas](../../schemas/rpc/v1) describe messages and results.
An oversized input frame is discarded within a bounded recovery window.
The transport uses no HTTP service or local listener. Vite's development
server serves only the optional contributor frontend.

## Windows contributor build

Install the repository package into a contributor Python environment or use
the Phase 6.5 private installation built from this branch. The desktop normally
resolves `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Corinthos\runtime\python.exe` and launches
the sidecar from that installation. For a contributor or CI runtime, set
`CORINTHOS_SIDECAR_PYTHON` to an absolute path to the installed-package
interpreter. The desktop resolves the interpreter itself and invokes a fixed
module. WebView requests never choose the executable.

The desktop spike uses Tauri 2, React 19, TypeScript 7, Vite 8 and npm.
The lockfiles fix frontend and Rust dependencies. Use Node 24.22.2,
npm 11.19.1 and Rust 1.99.1. The Windows desktop build uses the MSVC toolchain,
Windows SDK and WebView2. The backend remains usable without Node or Rust.

```powershell
cd apps/desktop
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run tauri -- build --no-bundle -- --locked
.\src-tauri\target\release\corinthos-desktop.exe
```

The Rust bridge starts one owned child, performs a bounded handshake and
serializes requests. It checks response IDs and forwards lifecycle events
separately. It uses an eight-second handshake, five-second request deadline
and one-second shutdown grace period. A transport failure disconnects the panel and allows a clean
restart. Normal close requests shutdown. The bridge waits for a bounded
interval, then terminates and reaps its child if needed. EOF also ends the
sidecar.

Windows CI builds the desktop and exercises the Rust/Python bridge against the
checksum-verified private runtime, with repeated start/stop and provider
sentinels. The original installer test and both OS/Python backend matrices
remain in place. Ubuntu continues to verify the platform-neutral Python
protocol through the package tests. Windows is the desktop build and WebView
gate.

Public desktop packaging and changes to the source installer belong to Phase 9.
Work Items, a full Project State, Agent Sessions, Context Projection, import,
provider switching and the complete Command view belong to later phases.
